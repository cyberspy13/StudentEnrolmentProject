Developer plan:
    1.Student management
    
    Need to create table/page in Business Central to store Student data.The newly created table/page should have list and card view with ability to add/modify the records.
    The fields should be next:
        -ID (PK) - DONE
        -Name - DONE
        -DOB - DONE
        -Contact Details - DONE
        -Other fields related to the personal information also present. - DONE 
    2.Course management

    Need to create table/page in Business Central to store Coursess information.Newly created table/page should have list and card view with ability to add/modify the records.
    The fields should be next:
        -Courses ID (PK) - DONE
        -Course name - DONE 
        -Course Overview - DONE
        -Course details and modules - DONE
        -Study Options - DONE
    User should search for the available Course and be able to select on one of the entry, submit enrolment request.
    We need to have some validation logic(to be confirmed) in here, if the current user can be enrolled for this course
    

    3.Enrolment Request Submission

    Need to create table/page in Business Central to store  Enrolment Requests.Newly created table/page should have list and card view with ability to add/modify the records.
    The fields should be next:
        -Entry No(PK)
        -Requested person details
        -Requested Course details
        -Timestamp and status

    4.Enrolment Request Approval/Rejection
    
    Need to create another table/page in BC with approval/rejection functionality with next fields:
        -status
        -comments
        -automatic update function of request upon dicision.We need to create that logic related to the Enrolment Request Submission page.
    
    5.Email notification

    Have to add  Automatic generation of email content based on request status changes:
        -Personalized notifications including student name, course details, and request outcome
        -Immediate notification dispatch upon request approval or rejection

    Suggestions on this one: we can use Business Central's email functionality, Implements an Email Notification codeunit to handle email generation and sending, 
         Triggers email notifications automatically as part of the approval/rejection process

Overall workflow:

System Integration
These components work together to create a seamless enrolment process:
1. Students, authenticated through the Student Management component, use the 
Enrolment Request Submission component to submit requests.
2. These requests are stored and made available to administrators through the Enrolment
Request Approval/Rejection component.
3. Administrators process requests, utilizing information from both Student Management 
and Course Management components.
4. Upon decision, the Email Notifications component is triggered to inform the student.
5. The Student Management and Course Management components are updated to reflect 
new enrolments.
