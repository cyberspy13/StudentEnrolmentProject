Overall workflow:

System Integration
These components work together to create a seamless enrolment process:
1. Students, authenticated through the Student Management component, use the 
Enrolment Request Submission component to submit requests.
2. These requests are stored and made available to administrators through the Enrolment
Request Approval/Rejection component.
3. Administrators process requests, utilizing information from both Student Management 
and Course Management components.
4. Upon decision, the Email Notifications component is triggered to inform the student.
5. The Student Management and Course Management components are updated to reflect 
new enrolments.
   

   Additional requirements:
• Status Tracking: Students can log in at any time to check their request status.
• Capacity Management: The system may automatically close enrolment for a course 
when it reaches capacity.
• Waitlisting: If a course is full, subsequent approved requests might be placed on a 
waitlist.
• Cancellations: Students might be given the option to cancel their enrolment, triggering 
a reverse workflow.
• Reporting: Administrators can generate reports on enrolment statistics, popular 
courses, etc.
