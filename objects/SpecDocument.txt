Overall workflow(STEPS):

1. The user search for the "Student Information page".
2. Press "New" and add informarion to the Student Card.
3. Then press on the "Find Course" ribbon tab and select interested entry from the Course list page.
4. If we dont have any courses in the list we need to add one or search for the Courses Information page and add from there.
5. Please note each course have "Additional Information" page where the user can add Course capacity limit. The logic kicks in, when the requests are higher then the limit.
6. Press "Assign Student ID" from the Course information page.
7. Go to the course and press "Enrol".
8. Notification message should be saying "you have successfully enroled to the course".
9. Capacity should increase by 1 every time when the user enroled to the course.
10. Search for the "Enrolment Request" page and "Approve" or "Reject" the entry.
11. It should automatically create an email saying it was approved and rejected.
